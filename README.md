# ReferenceUSA-Scraper

A simple scraper for the referenceUSA website. This was built using
the python requests module. It currently is getting caught by a captcha after 9-13 attempts.
Possibly due to bad cookie handling. I will reattempt this using Selenium, but I figured this may be useful
to someone else in the future.
